# add_something_positive

# Disclaimer

This app is pretty early on in its development, and things are subject to change.

# Purpose

Everyday life can get hectic, especially as someone living with ADHD and anxiety. I've found that taking some time to keep track of at least one positive thing per day helps me slow down and reflect.

# What this app does

You can enter something positive, save it to a local database, and reflect on other positive things you've written. You also have the option to delete entries too.

# Tech Stack

Vite: easily setting up Electron and React

Electron: so its its own app

JavaScript: frontend

React: mainly for rendering entries dynamically

Flask: connect to backend

Python: handling Flask requests

SQLite: storing entries in a local database
