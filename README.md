# add_something_positive

# Disclaimer

This app is pretty early on in its development, and things are subject to change.

# Purpose

Everyday life can get hectic, especially as someone living with ADHD and anxiety. I've found that taking some time to keep track of at least one positive thing per day helps me slow down and reflect.

# What this app does

You can enter something positive, save it to a local database, and reflect on other positive things you've written. You also have the option to delete entries too.

# Tech Stack

## Vite: easily setting up Electron and React

## Electron: so its its own app

## JavaScript: frontend

## React: mainly for rendering entries dynamically

## Flask: connect to backend

## Python: handling Flask requests

## SQLite: storing entries in a local database

# Setup

WIP: Need to do a proper write-up, and make execution as easy as possible.
In short (as of now): npm run dev for frontend folder. activate venv for backend and run dp.py
